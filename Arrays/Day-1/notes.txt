[Expected Approach] One Pass Search
The idea is to keep track of the largest and second largest element while traversing the array. Initialize largest and secondLargest with -1. Now, for any index i,

If arr[i] > largest, update secondLargest with largest and largest with arr[i].
Else If arr[i] < largest and arr[i] > secondLargest, update secondLargest with arr[i].

Time Complexity: O(n), as we are traversing the array only once.
Auxiliary space: O(1)
